## How to Play the Game

The game starts immediately when you load the page. The snake moves in the direction of the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to eat as many candies as possible without colliding with the snake's own body.

Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer and the game speed increases. The game ends when the snake collides with its own body.
